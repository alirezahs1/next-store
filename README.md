## Intro
This is a simple `next.js` project including simple product details page. The project is running on port `3008` as modified in `package.json` file. I used `tailwind` for styling.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3008/products/1](http://localhost:3008/products/1) with your browser to see the result.
